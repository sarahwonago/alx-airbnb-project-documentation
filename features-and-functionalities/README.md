# Airbnb Clone Backend â€“ Project Requirements

## Objective
Learners will identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

---

## Introduction to Project Requirements
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. This document focuses on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing the features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements are categorized into:
- **Core Functionalities**
- **Technical Requirements**
- **Non-Functional Requirements**

---

## Core Functionalities
The backend must support key features typical of a rental marketplace like Airbnb.

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration**: 
  - Guests and hosts can register.
  - Use secure authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **User Login & Authentication**: 
  - Login via email/password.
  - Support OAuth (Google, Facebook).
- **Profile Management**: 
  - Users can update personal info and upload profile photos.

### 2. Property Listings Management
- **Add Listings**: 
  - Hosts can create listings with title, description, price, location, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings**: 
  - Hosts can update or remove listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering
- Users can search properties by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool)
- Include pagination for performance with large datasets.

### 4. Booking Management
- **Booking Creation**:
  - Guests can book properties with date validation.
- **Booking Cancellation**:
  - Guests/hosts can cancel bookings according to policies.
- **Booking Status**:
  - Track booking states (pending, confirmed, canceled, completed).

### 5. Payment Integration
- Integrate secure gateways (Stripe, PayPal) to manage:
  - Upfront payments
  - Host payouts
  - Multi-currency support

### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- Guests leave reviews/ratings linked to specific bookings.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.

### 7. Notifications System
- Email and in-app notifications for:
  - Booking updates
  - Payment confirmations
  - Cancellations

### 8. Admin Dashboard
Admins can manage:
- Users
- Listings
- Bookings
- Payments

---

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management
- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
- Key tables:
  - Users
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

### 2. API Development
- Build **RESTful APIs**.
- Support standard HTTP methods:
  - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
- Use GraphQL for complex querying (optional).

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Implement **JWT-based authentication**.
- Role-based access control for:
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

### 4. File Storage (Scenario Based)
- Store images (properties, profiles) in file system or cloud (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary).
- Default: Local file storage for MVP.

### 5. Third-Party Services
- Use **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email delivery.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
- Centralized error handling
- Log requests, responses, and errors for debugging

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- Use **modular architecture**
- Enable **horizontal scaling** via load balancers

### 2. Security
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Use **Redis** for caching search results or sessions
- Optimize SQL queries and use indexes

### 4. Testing
- Write **unit and integration tests** (e.g., `pytest`)
- Include **automated API tests** for endpoints
